## Introduction and Project Motivation 

This is the Github repo of a small project, in which my objective was to write a Medium Post. It is about the recent downward evolution in Berlin's tree stock and its relation to climate change, a topic that motivates due to my passion for trees. I use data from the KNMI Climate Explorer (precipitation and temperature, for the 1878-2001 period) and from the city's senate (a data base of more than 766,000 trees). 

## File Description
[Here](https://github.com/ebelingbarros/Trees_in_Berlin/blob/main/1st%20project%20-%20Udacity.ipynb) is the link to the Jupyter Notebook, where I created some preliminary visualisations. The notebook is exploratory as I search through the data listed above. I use markdown to assist understanding the thought process for individual steps. 

However, the visualisations I included in the story were created in Tableau, and are available by [accessing my Tableau page](https://public.tableau.com/profile/francisco.ebeling#!/). 

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://ebelingbarros.medium.com/global-warming-and-berlins-trees-eea96cfbf6ee).
