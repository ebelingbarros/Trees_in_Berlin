This is the Github repo of a small project, in which my objective was to write a Medium Post, which can be read by clicking [here](https://ebelingbarros.medium.com/global-warming-and-berlins-trees-eea96cfbf6ee). It is about the recent downward evolution in Berlin's tree stock and its relation to climate change. I use data from the KNMI Climate Explorer (precipitation and temperature, for the 1878-2001 period) and from the city's senate (a data base of more than 766,000 trees). 

[Here](https://github.com/ebelingbarros/Trees_in_Berlin/blob/main/1st%20project%20-%20Udacity.ipynb) is the link to the Jupyter Notebook, where I created some preliminary visualisations. However, the visualisations I included in the story were created in Tableau, and are available by [accessing my Tableau page](https://public.tableau.com/profile/francisco.ebeling#!/).
